# Tactic pattern ledger

Record repeated proof patterns before introducing a new tactic. Prefer an
existing theorem, then a reusable lemma or simp set; promote a new abstraction
only after at least three genuine occurrences across two files. Occurrences
in a regression file are not additional mathematical consumers.

## Promoted

No new tactic or automation is introduced for shifted spectral truncation.
The proofs reuse existing functional-calculus identities, projection
rank/trace comparison, range-of-composition, and scalar real-power bounds.

### Unit-blank contraction in restoration — promoted lemmas (2026-10-08)

- **Pattern:** Expand restoring matrix entries and contract unit ancillary
  blanks through `∑ i, star (b i) * b i = 1`.
- **Seen:** The copied-vector identity in `RestoringVectors.lean` and the actual
  ground-component coefficient proof in `RestoringGroundComponent.lean`.
- **Abstraction:** Promote the already proved blank normalization and restoring
  entry formula as `restoringBlank_sum_eq_one` and
  `restoringOperatorWithAncilla_apply`, preserving their existing proof bodies.
  The new coefficient proof reuses both instead of duplicating those expansions.
- **Caveats:** Blank norms are Euclidean. The copied ancillary coordinate runs
  over the whole basis, including coordinates with zero assigned probability.

## Candidates

### Orthogonal projection mass from the actual marginal — candidate (2026-10-07)

- **Pattern:** Use the partial-trace pairing, cyclicity of trace and the pure
  matrix trace to express a projected mass as a sesquilinear pairing. Move
  the projector across that pairing, then use idempotence, self-adjointness
  and the Euclidean norm identity.
- **Seen:** The private `norm_sq_mulVec_eq_re_trace` calculation in
  `QICLean/Entropy/PureTensorPower.lean`, and the local `hmass` calculation
  in `TensorPower.exists_labelProj_norm_mass_ge` on the separate
  `SchurSectorMass` contribution. These are two mathematical consumers.
- **Abstraction:** The actual product marginal and projected-mass identities
  are the public conclusions here. Keep the general pairing calculation
  private while the two contributions remain independent; reconsider a
  shared lemma when a third mathematical consumer occurs.
- **Caveats:** Orthogonality is proved for the actual projector. Neither the
  desired projected mass nor a supplied reduced-density identity is assumed.

### Finite-spectrum functional-calculus scalar reduction — candidate (2026-10-07)

- **Pattern:** Rewrite matrices as Hermitian functional calculi, combine
  products with `← hA.cfc_mul`, and reduce the equality to a pointwise
  threshold split followed by scalar simplification.
- **Seen:** In `QICLean/Analysis/ShiftedDensityTruncation.lean`,
  `IsHermitian.isStarProjection_spectralProjectionGE`,
  `PosSemidef.commute_add_smul_one_rpow_spectralProjectionGE`,
  `PosSemidef.shiftedPowerHead_eq_cfc`, and
  `PosSemidef.shiftedPowerHead_mul_shiftedPowerTail` are representative
  occurrences. Their scalar conclusions differ.
- **Abstraction:** Continue using the existing `Matrix.IsHermitian.cfc_mul`
  and `cfc_congr` results. A specialized automation rule is not justified
  by repetition in this single module.
- **Caveats:** Continuity is required only on the finite spectrum. Do not
  claim global continuity of a threshold indicator. Nonnegativity and
  norm estimates still require the correct PSD and exponent hypotheses.

### Reverse range inclusion from a commuting inverse — candidate (2026-10-07)

- **Pattern:** Prove both range inclusions from H = ΠF and Π = HF⁻¹, using
  `LinearMap.range_comp_le_range` after translating matrix products.
- **Seen:** The two inclusions in
  `Matrix.PosSemidef.range_shiftedPowerHead`; one mathematical consumer
  in one file.
- **Abstraction:** Keep the existing range-of-composition theorem. The
  public range equality is the reusable mathematical result; introducing
  another tactic would not remove independent repeated work.
- **Caveats:** Commutation and the actual inverse identity are proved before
  use. Neither an abstract range certificate nor invertibility of the
  unshifted PSD matrix is assumed.
