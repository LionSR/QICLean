# Tactic pattern ledger

Record repeated proof patterns before introducing a new tactic. Prefer an
existing theorem, then a reusable lemma or simp set; promote a new abstraction
only after at least three genuine occurrences across two files. Occurrences
in a regression file are not additional mathematical consumers.

## Promoted

No new tactic or automation is introduced for shifted spectral truncation.
The proofs reuse existing functional-calculus identities, projection
rank/trace comparison, range-of-composition, and scalar real-power bounds.

### Unit-blank contraction in restoration — promoted lemmas (2026-10-08)

- **Pattern:** Expand restoring matrix entries and contract unit ancillary
  blanks through `∑ i, star (b i) * b i = 1`.
- **Seen:** The copied-vector identity in `RestoringVectors.lean` and the actual
  ground-component coefficient proof in `RestoringGroundComponent.lean`.
- **Abstraction:** Promote the already proved blank normalization and restoring
  entry formula as `restoringBlank_sum_eq_one` and
  `restoringOperatorWithAncilla_apply`, preserving their existing proof bodies.
  The new coefficient proof reuses both instead of duplicating those expansions.
- **Caveats:** Blank norms are Euclidean. The copied ancillary coordinate runs
  over the whole basis, including coordinates with zero assigned probability.

## Candidates

### Commutation with a matrix inverse — candidate (2026-10-07)

- **Pattern:** Give a positive definite matrix its existing `Invertible`
  instance, use `Commute.invOf_right` or `commute_invOf`, and rewrite
  `Matrix.invOf_eq_nonsing_inv`.
- **Seen:** Three inverse-commutation steps in
  `QICLean/Analysis/PatchRegulator.lean`; one file.
- **Abstraction:** The existing Mathlib commutation lemmas suffice. Retain
  this record until independent occurrences in another file justify a
  matrix-specific lemma; no new tactic is introduced.

### Finite-spectrum functional-calculus scalar reduction — candidate (2026-10-07)

- **Pattern:** Rewrite matrices as Hermitian functional calculi, combine
  products with `← hA.cfc_mul`, and reduce the equality to a pointwise
  threshold split followed by scalar simplification.
- **Seen:** In `QICLean/Analysis/ShiftedDensityTruncation.lean`,
  `IsHermitian.isStarProjection_spectralProjectionGE`,
  `PosSemidef.commute_add_smul_one_rpow_spectralProjectionGE`,
  `PosSemidef.shiftedPowerHead_eq_cfc`, and
  `PosSemidef.shiftedPowerHead_mul_shiftedPowerTail` are representative
  occurrences. In `QICLean/Analysis/SpectralCutoffMass.lean`,
  `PosSemidef.smul_one_sub_spectralCutoff_le` uses the corresponding
  pointwise order reduction; `PosSemidef.spectralCutoff_mass_ge` then takes
  its quadratic form. Their scalar conclusions differ.
- **Abstraction:** Continue using the existing `Matrix.IsHermitian.cfc_mul`
  and `cfc_congr` results for identities, and the generic `cfc_le_iff`
  result for order. The local `hcont` in the cutoff proof supplies
  continuity on the finite spectrum for each scalar function without
  repeating the same continuity argument. These existing mechanisms
  already provide the scalar reduction; no new tactic is introduced.
- **Caveats:** Continuity is required only on the finite spectrum. Do not
  claim global continuity of a threshold indicator. Nonnegativity and
  norm estimates still require the correct PSD and exponent hypotheses.

### Reverse range inclusion from a commuting inverse — candidate (2026-10-07)

- **Pattern:** Prove both range inclusions from H = ΠF and Π = HF⁻¹, using
  `LinearMap.range_comp_le_range` after translating matrix products.
- **Seen:** The two inclusions in
  `Matrix.PosSemidef.range_shiftedPowerHead`; one mathematical consumer
  in one file.
- **Abstraction:** Keep the existing range-of-composition theorem. The
  public range equality is the reusable mathematical result; introducing
  another tactic would not remove independent repeated work.
- **Caveats:** Commutation and the actual inverse identity are proved before
  use. Neither an abstract range certificate nor invertibility of the
  unshifted PSD matrix is assumed.

### Copy-permutation commutation from invariant entries — candidate (2026-10-07)

- **Pattern:** Reindex a literal finite product, or a sum of such products, by
  the inverse copy permutation; convert the resulting simultaneous row and
  column invariance into matrix commutation.
- **Seen:** The replica sum and constant tensor power in
  `QICLean/Analysis/ReplicaPermutationCovariance.lean`; two consumers in one
  file.
- **Abstraction:** The private `commute_copyPerm_of_invariant_entries` shares
  the matrix permutation calculation. The finite reindexing uses existing
  `Fintype.sum_equiv` and `Fintype.prod_equiv`; no new tactic is introduced.
- **Caveats:** Respect the inverse convention of `permOp`. Use the existing
  `Commute.cfc_real` to transfer actual commutation to real functional
  calculus; no continuity or invariance hypothesis on the cutoff is added.

### Permutation covariance of exact sectors — candidate (2026-10-08)

- **Pattern:** Reindex the one-copy product by the inverse permutation, tracking
  the image of its distinguished subset, and reduce matrix multiplication by
  permutation matrices with the existing `PEquiv` multiplication lemmas.
- **Seen:** Exact-sector covariance in `Analysis/ReplicaExcitationSymmetry.lean`;
  invariant-entry reduction in `Analysis/ReplicaPermutationCovariance.lean`.
- **Abstraction:** The existing `PEquiv.toMatrix_toPEquiv_mul` and
  `PEquiv.mul_toMatrix_toPEquiv` perform the matrix calculation in both files.
  The public covariance theorem handles all actual excitation subsets; its
  stabilizer and auxiliary consequences reuse it. No new tactic is needed.
- **Caveat:** The image is σB for the convention x(j)↦x(σ⁻¹j). An individual
  subset projection commutes only with its stabilizer, not arbitrary metrics.

### Marginal invariance from a simultaneous fixed vector — candidate (2026-10-08)

- **Pattern:** Convert a fixed-vector equation into conjugation invariance of
  its rank-one density, apply existing partial-trace covariance, and cancel
  the adjoint of the retained unitary.
- **Seen:** `Analysis/ReplicaMarginalSymmetry.lean`; one mathematical
  calculation and its excitation-component corollary.
- **Abstraction:** The public fixed-vector theorem supplies the common
  partial-trace step. The component corollary reuses it after deriving
  fixedness from the stabilizer theorem. No new tactic is needed.
- **Caveat:** Invariance alone does not imply that different copies are
  independent or establish a merge-moment bound.
### Norm of a finite product of vectors — candidate (2026-10-07)

- **Pattern:** Reduce normalization to a one-coordinate sum, then apply
  `Fintype.prod_sum` to the literal finite product. For complex pairings,
  distribute the product over multiplication; for squared norms, use
  `norm_prod` and `Finset.prod_pow`.
- **Seen:** The contraction recovery and norm equality in
  `QICLean/Analysis/ReplicaGoodCopyFactorization.lean`; one file.
- **Abstraction:** Existing finite sum and product identities suffice. No
  new public tensor-vector definition or automation is introduced.
- **Caveats:** Retain the canonical coordinate equivalence and every
  auxiliary coordinate. Empty products have value one.

### Finite-product partial traces — candidate (2026-10-08)

- **Pattern:** Reindex a partial trace by the existing finite-product splitting equivalence, insert the proved coordinate factorization, and factor the resulting finite sums.
- **Seen:** Ground-copy contraction and norm preservation in `Analysis/ReplicaGoodCopyFactorization.lean`, and marginal identification in `Analysis/ReplicaGoodCopyDensity.lean`.
- **Abstraction:** The existing `FiniteProduct.splitEquiv`, `Fintype.prod_sum`, and finite-sum multiplication lemmas supply the reindexing and product calculation. The new public density identities carry these calculations to later consumers; no new tactic is introduced.
- **Caveat:** Normalization belongs only to the prescribed ground vector. The excitation component and its auxiliary marginal may have zero or arbitrary total mass.


### Regional finite-product marginal — candidate (2026-10-08)

- **Pattern:** Use the chosen finite-set enumeration to convert a good-copy product to a finite Kronecker power, and apply `Fintype.prod_sum` after tracing one physical coordinate per copy.
- **Seen:** `Analysis/ReplicaRegionalDensity.lean`; the auxiliary marginal calculation in `Analysis/ReplicaGoodCopyDensity.lean` uses the same existing finite-product identities.
- **Abstraction:** Existing `Equiv.prod_comp`, `Fintype.prod_sum` and finite-sum multiplication lemmas perform the calculation. The new regional density theorem carries it to the physical consumer; no new tactic is introduced.
- **Caveat:** Keep the literal excitation component and its own auxiliary density. Only the prescribed one-copy ground vector is normalized.
### Contraction of the repeated uniform pair — candidate (2026-10-07)

- **Pattern:** Expand a Kronecker action against the actual repeated uniform
  pair, rewrite its coordinates as a scalar times the equality indicator,
  and contract one coordinate sum.
- **Seen:** The two private coordinate identities in
  `QICLean/Representation/UniformBellLabel.lean`; two occurrences in one file.
- **Abstraction:** The public projected-norm and nonzero-occurrence theorems
  supply the mathematical consequences. A separate tactic is not warranted
  by two coordinate contractions.
- **Caveats:** The normalization depends on the actual one-copy dimension;
  nonzero occurrence requires that dimension to be positive. The central
  Schur label equality additionally uses inversion-invariant coefficients.
